# Available modules (uncomment to use):

dk use: cram              # run tests using the "cram" functional test tool
dk use: entr-watch        # watch files and re-run tests or other commands
dk use: shell-console     # make the "console" command enter a subshell
dk use: bash32            # enable doing tests/console/etc. in bash3.2 w/docker

# Define overrides, new commands, functions, etc. here:

cram.files() { ls README.md specs/*.cram.md; }

dk.test() {
    export PATH="$LOCO_ROOT:$PATH"  # put bashup.events on PATH
    dk cram
